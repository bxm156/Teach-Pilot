        Applet: An applet is a Java program designed to be executed in a web page through a navigator who supports Java. 
                All the last versions of Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer include it by defect. 
        WIRIS CAS (Computer Algebra System): mathematical calculation Tool that works through an applet. 
        Web Service: A web service is a component of software that can describe itself and provides certain functionality to 
                other applications, through an Internet connection. 
        WIRIS EDITOR: Formulas publisher who allows to generate images of these formulas through a Web Service. 
        Regular expression: A regular expression is a model or a form to compare with a chain of characters. 

    Wiris Filter Description: It is a filter that allows to visualize applets that use WIRIS CAS and images (of formulas) 
                generated through the WIRIS Formula Image Service.

    Technical description:
        The filter begins its execution with the function 'wiris_filter'. 
        This means that it will not be called from any other function defined here if is not through this one.

				Replaces all substrings '«applet ... «/applet»' by the corresponding WIRIS applet code: '<applet ... </applet>'
				Replaces all substrings '«math ... «/math»' by the corresponding MathML code: '<math ... </math>'
