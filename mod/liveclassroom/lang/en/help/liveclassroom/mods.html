<div class="indent">
<p>
Live Classroom allows students and instructors to meet synchronously online,using multi-way audio and video, application sharing, and content display,enabling instructors to add vitally important elements of interaction thatsimply cannot be provided in a text-based course. Sessions within LiveClassroom may be recorded for future review.

<p>
Rooms are either instructor-led (only instructors have presenter rights), orpresentation rights may be shared by both students and instructors (designedfor student collaboration in the absence of an instructor).
