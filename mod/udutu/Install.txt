HOW TO INSTALL THE myUDUTU MODULE
---------------------------------


Installing myUdutu module is as easy as installing other modules in Moodle. Just unzip the myUdutu archive file under /moodle/mod/udutu folder (you will have to create a 'udutu' directory) in your Moodle installation. Then, start Moodle and login with your administrator account. Next, click on notifications - Moodle will then start to create necessary database tables. 

To access the module, click on the Modules tab and click 'Activities'. Your installation should appear as the name myUdutu.

Don't forget that the default upload limitation for php and SCORM/AICC module of moodle is set to 2MB, to upload bigger files :

In moodle, for each course you should click settings on main course screen and then change maximum upload size.

In php, go to your main php installation folder and locate the 'php.ini' file. Right click on that file and open with your text editor. Then make this necessary changes:


post_max_size //set to a number high enough to accept your largest course
upload_max_filesize // set to a number high enough
mysql.connect_timeout // set to -1 for unlimited time or a number high enough
max_execution_time  // set to -1 for unlimited time or a number high enough
max_input_time	// set to -1 for unlimited time or a number high enough
memory_limit // set to a number high enough 

This module is compatible with moodle 1.8 and 1.9.  (1.95 can be found at http://www.myudutu.com/downloads/moodle/v1_95/udutu.zip
