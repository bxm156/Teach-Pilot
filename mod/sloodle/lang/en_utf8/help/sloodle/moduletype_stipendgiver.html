<h4>Stipend Giver</h4>
<p>
 This is a sub-type of the SLOODLE module, allowing you to setup a means to pay a certain amount of Linden Dollars to your students in Second Life.
 In order to make the transfer, you will need to setup a SLOODLE Stipend Giver object in Second Life as well, and connect it to your Stipend Giver in Moodle.
 Students can then click the object in Second Life to receive their payment.
