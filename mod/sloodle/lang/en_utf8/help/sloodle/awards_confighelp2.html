Each Sloodle Awards System can be connected to an "Sloodle Award assignment."  Once you connect a Sloodle Awards System to a Sloodle Award Assignment, all points earned by students get added to the gradebook. If no assignments are listed in the drop down box, you will have to create a new assignment first.  When you create an assignment, you must choose "Sloodle Award" as the assignment type.
