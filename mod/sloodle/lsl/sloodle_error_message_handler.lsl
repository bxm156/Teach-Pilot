*  This script is intended to translate error messages sent via linked messages from sloodle scripts.
*  All Sloodle Status codes from our wiki at: http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/sl/index.php/Sloodle_status_codes 
*  have been added to an LSL list.  I have also added standard HTTP error status's so we can give more
*  detailed information to our lovely sloodlers during the confuration stage of Sloodle.
*
*  USE:  To use this script, simply include our premade function "sloodle_error_code" in your script
*  sloodle_error_code(string method, key avuuid,integer statuscode){
*       llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, SLOODLE_CHANNEL_ERROR_TRANSLATION_REQUEST, method+"|"+(string)avuuid+"|
*       +(string)statuscode, NULL_KEY);
*   }
*  
*  Then in your code, use it like: sloodle_error_code(SLOODLE_TRANSLATE_SAY, NULL_KEY,statuscode); 
*
*  All messages should be sent on this channel: 
*  integer SLOODLE_CHANNEL_ERROR_TRANSLATION_REQUEST=-1828374651;
